I am pleased to announce version 3.0 of Alex, the lexical analyser
generator for Haskell.

Changes in Alex 3.0 vs. 2.3.5:

    * Unicode support (contributed mostly by Jean-Philippe Bernardy,
      with help from Alan Zimmerman).

      * An Alex lexer now takes a UTF-8 encoded byte sequence as input
        (see Section 5.1, “Unicode and UTF-8”. If you are using the
        "basic" wrapper or one of the other wrappers that takes a
        Haskell String as input, the string is automatically encoded
        into UTF-8 by Alex. If your input is a ByteString, you are
        responsible for ensuring that the input is UTF-8 encoded. The
        old 8-bit behaviour is still available via the --latin1
        option.

      * Alex source files are asumed to be in UTF-8, like Haskell
        source files. The lexer specification can use Unicode
        characters and ranges.

      * alexGetChar is renamed to alexGetByte in the generated code.

      * There is a new option, --latin1, that restores the old
        behaviour.

    * Alex now does DFA minimization, which helps to reduce the size
      of the generated tables, especially for lexers that use Unicode.
